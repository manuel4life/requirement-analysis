# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system, following industry-standard SDLC practices. It demonstrates how to translate business needs into structured technical requirements through clear documentation and visual modeling. The project will showcase functional/non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria for a robust booking solution.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating what a software system needs to do. It is a crucial first phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures developers build the right solution for the users' needs.

Key reasons it's important:
- Prevents misunderstandings between stakeholders
- Reduces costly changes later in development
- Provides clear guidelines for designers and programmers
- Helps create accurate timelines and budgets
